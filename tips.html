    <h2>Interview Tips</h2>
    <p class="subtitle">Simple advice to help you feel confident and prepared</p>

    <div class="tips-container">
        <div class="tip-card">
            <h3>Understand the Role</h3>
            <p>Study the job description carefully. Identify the key skills and responsibilities, then prepare examples that show you match them. Interviewers look for relevance, not perfection.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-card">
            <h3>Prepare Clear, Structured Answers</h3>
            <p>Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to answer questions. Structured answers sound confident, professional, and easy to follow.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-card">
            <h3>Practice Out Loud, Not in Your Head</h3>
            <p>Thinking is not enough. Speaking out loud improves clarity, reduces hesitation, and helps you sound natural under pressure.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-card">
            <h3>Control Your First 90 Seconds</h3>
            <p>First impressions matter. Sit straight, make eye contact, smile slightly, and speak clearly. Confidence at the beginning sets the tone for the entire interview.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-card">
            <h3>Listen More Than You Speak</h3>
            <p>Don’t rush your answers. Listen carefully, pause briefly, then respond. Thoughtful answers are more impressive than fast ones.</p>
        </div>

         <div class="tip-card">
            <h3>Turn Weaknesses into Growth</h3>
            <p>When asked about weaknesses, focus on what you learned and how you improved. Show self-awareness and progress, not excuses.</p>
        </div>

         <div class="tip-card">
            <h3>Body Language Matters</h3>
            <p>Maintain eye contact, sit straight, and use calm gestures to show confidence and engagement.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-card">
            <h3>Show Motivation, Not Desperation</h3>
            <p>Explain why the role interests you and how it fits your goals. Employers want motivated candidates, not just available ones.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-card">
            <h3>Ask Smart Questions at the End</h3>
            <p>Prepare 2–3 questions about the role, team, or growth opportunities. Smart questions show engagement and professionalism.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-card">
            <h3>Stay Calm Under Pressure</h3>
            <p>If you don’t understand a question, ask for clarification. Taking a moment to think is better than giving a rushed answer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-card">
            <h3>Finish Strong</h3>
            <p>Thank the interviewer confidently, reaffirm your interest, and leave with positive energy. The ending is just as important as the start.</p>
